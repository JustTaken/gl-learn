# OpenGL
It's an abstraction layer for us to comunicate with our graphics
card, and draw things on the screen with it.

# Formal definition
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform
application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D
vector graphics.

# Purpose
I think that graphics programing is cool, so i'm trying it out.
